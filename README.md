# Database	Administration	and	Database	Management	Concepts

The scope of this course included the development and management of databases for information systems. It encompasses data analysis techniques, data modeling, and schema design. 

The cummulative final project for this course was to design	and	implement	a	database	to	solve	a	data	management	problem. I chose 	to design, implement, and manipulate a database for a fictional travel agency, Borten Overseas.
